## Desing

The basic premise of the app is that the user would like to produce a weekly grocery list of foods optimized according to dietary recommendations and their unique taste, requirements and preferences.

The weekly, whole family, grocery list as the focus of dietary intake tracking, replaces the meal by meal book keeping som diet tracking apps provide. Thus reducing the book keeping effort to simply asking: "Was the grocery list consumed?"

## Visual hiearchy

### Main navigation

Responsive: On tablet/desktop size a nav-bar to the left. On phones as a tab-bar at the bottom.

- Family
- Foods
- Meals

#### Family

Manage the family for whom to plan meals.

- List / Add / Remove family members
- Navigate to family member sub-page Nutritional requirements and dietary preferences 

Visually can be a list of cards with. Toggle edit-mode to show a placeholder "+"-card to add new members, and "Remove" buttons. When list is empty start in edit-mode.

The default dietary profile will be based on the Nordict Nutritional Recommendation guidelines. Might want to allow for individual tweaks here though, possibly even at the family level.

#### Foods

Select foods to include in the grocery list

The software automatically optimizes relative quantites based on teh nutritional requirements, recommendations and dietary preferences.

To aid food selection the software suggests foods that would help balance the nutritional profile.

#### Meals

Compose recipies of the foods

The software helps by grouping agonistic food items together, and separating antagonstic ones.
The sofware may also help highlight individual plate differences (replacing using a meat substitute on one plate f.ex)

At this stage the user probably want to add additional foods quickly without navigating back to the Foods page

It might also be helpful to quantizise some food items here. F.ex. easily perishable items such as a lettuce head should be bought and consumed in whole.
