> An application to plan a well balanced diet

This is (going to be) an application to help analyze the nutritional content of various foods. And help with optimizing a suitable composition given nutritional needs according to available reasearch (and probably some dogma and superstition)

In particular the focus of the application is the balance of micronutients. Where other applications focus on macronutrients, or micronutrient groups, the aim of this application is to get down to the details while still being simple to use.
